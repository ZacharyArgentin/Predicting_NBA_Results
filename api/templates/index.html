    <h2>Predicting NBA Results</h2>
    <p>
        This app uses machine learning to predict the winner of NBA games.
        Stats are pulled from <a href=https://www.balldontlie.io target="_blank">balldontlie.io</a> to determine the team's recent form.
        The machine learning model compares the stats between the 2 teams and then
        predicts who will win. The model also shows how confident it is in its prediction.
        The model was trained by looking at stats from over 40,000 NBA games.
